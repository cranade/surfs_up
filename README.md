# Report on Temperature Trends for June and December in Oahu

## Chandrashekhar G. Ranade

### Background
Mr. W. Avy liked our analysis of the temperature in Oahu presented by using histogram for the frequency
for different temperature ranges. However, he wants specifically more analysis related to the months of June
and December so that he could decide about the sustainability of the business related to surging and ice-cream
shop in Oahu

Our consultance firm took that as a challenge and did analysis for the Summer (a month in summer) and December (a month in winter).

We are presenting the following two tables related to these two months.

Looking at the tables related to the temperatures in June and December we are pleased to recommend to Mr.Avy that
there is not much difference in temperatures between the two months. For example on June 2, 2010 the temperature was 76 degree Fahrenheit, the temperature on December 1 was the same in the same year. There could be few cold days in December like December 6 and 7, our recommendation is to ignore those days.

The summary statistics for both months is also presented below.
